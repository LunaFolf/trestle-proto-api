# Trestle Proto
The Trestle Proto API is a development tool, used for testing new features, debugging and conceptualising.

The `trestle-proto-api` is not really meant for public consumption, but is available regardless; maybe you'll find what I'm tinkering with/working on interesting.

## Setup
* Download/Clone to repo.
* Use `npm ci` to do a fresh install.
* Create your `.env` file, an example `exampleEnv` file should be available for you to copy from.
* Setup external dependencies (i.e. Database).
* Start the API using `npm start` (or `npm run start`, both do the same thing).
